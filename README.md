Plugin - For subfolder networks, have the Create New Site form site the home and siteurl's to a subdomain

## Description ##

...

## Installation ##

The plugin should either be installed as a mu-plugin or network activated. It's a network plugin and therefore cannot be activated on individual sites on the network.

1. Ensure your site is a [WordPress Network setup](https://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network)
	1. Using folders, not subdomain sub sites
	1. & The primary domain must not include "www."
1. Upload `/network-pseduo-sub-domains/` to `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` or `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. If uploaded to the latter, activate the plugin through the 'Network Â» Plugins' menu in WordPress

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Is a multisite setup the same as a network? ###

Yes. The verbiage is interchangable.

### What if my site is not a network setup? ###

Then this is not the plugin you're looking for.

### Why does this plugin require such a high version of PHP? ###

It doesn't, this plugin will run stable on >= 5.6. Flagging this requirment higher than needed
helps push WordPress users and hosts to upgrading to the safer and faster versions of PHP.
